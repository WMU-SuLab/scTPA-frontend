## The frontend code for [scTPA](http://sctpa.bio-data.cn/sctpa)
scTPA is a web tool for single-cell transcriptome analysis and annotation based on biological pathway activation in human and mice. We collected a large number of biological pathways with different functional and taxonomic classifications, which facilitates the identification of key pathway signatures for cell type annotation and interpretation. 

## plugins
1. [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com) for 2D and 3D scatter plot
2. [Bootstrap-table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/content/tables/) for cell-type-specific pathways
3. [clustergrammer](http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/clustergrammer/) for expression profile heatmap
